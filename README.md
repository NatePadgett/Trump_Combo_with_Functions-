# Trump_Combo_with_Functions

For this project, I returned to my previous [Trump_Combo](https://github.com/NatePadgett/Trump_Combo) project and cleaned up the code a bit with functions and modules.

CODE OVERVIEW
-------------

There are four python files in this repository: word_count_functions.py is my original word_count.py file from the original project, only now the word indexing and sorting is pulled into the script via a module. This module is associated with another python file called filereader.py, which contains my file reading function. 

I also attached the original Trump_Combine.py script and a new Trump_Combine_Functions.py script because I haven't been able to get the functions in the latter to work. I wanted to put the for loops that are used to sort and remix the text into functions so I could pull them out into modules and shorten the main script. However, when I run it, the functions return empty strings, despite the code within them being the same as with the standalone for loops. I need to play with this more to get it working, but for the purposes of this assignment, my working word_count_functions.py and fileread.py scripts will suffice.
